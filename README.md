<h1>AirBNB Project</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of exploratory analysis as towether or not AirBNB listings that do not allow smoking have more rentals or less. I start by first creating the tables based on the CSV and ist columns, then i assign a data type based on the columns values. I then perform  data wrangling to prepare the data for analysis. This consists of correcting megative numbers, resolving misspellings,  correcting null values, and other minor adjustments to the data and the data structure. Though not a complex query, It is a display of evaluating data to give business insight as to how allowing or not allowing smoking can effect revenue.
